# Angular-Render-Web-Building

## Description

### Projet description

This GitHub repository provides a powerful tool for developers looking to build web applications using AngularJS.  
It allows users to design, compile, and test their applications efficiently.  
With **Render** integration, you can easily deploy your project and see it live. üåê The process starts with creating your AngularJS application, followed by compiling it using Angular CLI.  
You can then test your application locally before deploying it on Render for real-time visualization. üöÄ  
This is an ideal solution for those seeking to optimize their web development workflow.

---

# **TUTORIAL** - Deploy a Web Project to Render Using AngularJS (or Any Web Project)

This tutorial will guide you through downloading, configuring, forking, and deploying a web project on Render using AngularJS as an example.

---

## 1. **Download the Project**

- Clone the project to your local machine.
- Use the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
     ```

## 2. **Adjust Configuration if Needed (Optional)**

- Before starting, make sure the project configuration matches your needs.
- Check for the following:
  - Configure the `Dockerfile` file, or other file.
  - Any other environment-specific settings (environment variables, file paths, etc..).

   *Example:* For Angular projects, you might want to check the `angular.json` file or the environment settings in `src/environments/`.

## 3. **Fork the Project or Create a New Repository**

- If you want to make changes, you can either:
  - **Fork** the project (by clicking "Fork" on GitHub) to create a copy under your GitHub account.
  - **Create a new repository** on GitHub to host a modified version of the project.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sur GitHub configurer sa pour avoir des envois automatiques des Push dans les repository sur Render ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - In the repository go to `Settings`
  - `Security` -> `Secret and variables` -> `Actions`
  - Create a `New repository secret`
  - Add a the name "RENDER"

### Sub-steps to Fork the Project

- Go to the project page on GitHub.
- Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.
- After forking, you'll have a copy of the project under your GitHub account.

### Sub-steps to Create a New Repository

- Go to GitHub and click **New Repository**.
- Name your repository and add initial files if necessary.

## 4. **Add Your Build to the `deployApp` Folder**

- After customizing or building your project, you need to place the ready-to-deploy version in a folder called `deployApp`.

### Sub-steps for Angular

- If you're using Angular, build the project with the following command:

     ```bash
     ng build --prod
     ```

- Look the <https://github.com/Mfxof/Angular-Render-Web-Building/tree/Angular-Build-App>
- This will generate an optimized version of your project in the `/dist` folder.
- Copy the files from the `dist/` folder to the `deployApp/` folder.

## 5. **Push the Modifications to Your Repository**

- Once you've added the build to the `deployApp` folder, it's time to push the changes to your GitHub repository.

### Sub-steps to Push

- Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following commands:

     ```bash
     git add deployApp/
     git commit -m "Added build to deployApp"
     git push origin main
     ```

## 6. **Go to [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/)**

- If you don't have a Render account yet, create one [here](https://dashboard.render.com/register).

### Sub-steps to Create a Render Account

- Click **Sign Up**.
- Choose your sign-up method (GitHub, Google, or Email).
  - **Choose GitHub if you can.** ‚ö†Ô∏è *(To have a automatic connect to your repository)*
- Follow the instructions to complete your account creation.

## 7. **Create a New Project on Render**

- Once logged in to Render, follow these steps to create a new project.

### Sub-steps

- Go to your dashboard.
- Click **Create New Project**.
- Name your project (e.g., "My AngularJS Project").
- Select your GitHub repository (the one where you pushed the project in `deployApp`).

---

The next steps will include configuring deployment settings and launching the project on Render.
